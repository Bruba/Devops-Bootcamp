# Project 3: Setup Load Balancing for Static Website Using Nginx

This project aims to teach Layer 7 load balancing and load balancing algorithms using Nginx as a Load Balancer.

## Type of Load Balancer

This is a reverse proxy load balancer configuration in Nginx, where Nginx acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from the servers behind it. It's capable of distributing traffic across the servers listed in the upstream block.

## Characteristics

- **HTTP Load Balancing:** This configuration balances HTTP requests.

- **Round Robin:** By default, Nginx uses a round-robin algorithm to distribute traffic evenly among the servers unless otherwise specified.

- **Scalability:** You can add more servers in the upstream block to scale out your application.
